= Jooq Generator

Idea: Use a spring-boot commandline app to generate the JOOQ code:

- Spring Boot to benefit from the spring features like dependency injection, testcontainer support
- Commandline bc. the code needs to be generated only once


During startup the JOOQ Code Generator will be invoked programmatically and not in the build script.

This scope of this project should only restrict to JOOQ Code Generation and not be an application in addition.
